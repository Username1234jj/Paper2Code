## 📘 Overview

**Paper2Code** helps researchers and developers quickly transform complex research papers into executable machine learning code.  
This project demonstrates how AI can automate the research-to-implementation process.

It’s perfect for:
- AI & ML researchers
- Students exploring paper replication
- Anyone who wants to bridge the gap between theory and code

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧩 Extracts key methods and equations from a paper  
- 🧠 Uses AI tools to generate corresponding code (Python, PyTorch, or TensorFlow)  
- 📄 Converts plain text summaries into reproducible code blocks  
- 🚀 Runs directly on Google Colab (no local setup required)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Google Colab**
- **OpenAI / Hugging Face Models**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn**
- **LangChain / GPT API (optional)**

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Colab:  
   [▶️ Run on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Username1234jj/Paper2Code/blob/main/Paper2code.ipynb)
2. Upload or link your research paper (PDF or text).  
3. Follow the notebook cells step by step.  
4. View or export the generated code output.
